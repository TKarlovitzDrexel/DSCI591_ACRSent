The only reason he writes is to entertain.  &#34;I never want to make the reader do anything but go 'cool' and that's it.&#34;  (Aug. 17, 2015 interview at L.A. Google office)  I suspect his stated intent explains the difference in mentality between those who love and those who hate the book.  I have a background in physics and work in aerospace/defense as an analyst, so qualify as a nerd who appreciates the technical details.  But the thought I had over and over while trying to slog through the book is why try to stretch what seems to be a &#34;how-to manual&#34; into novel form at all??  There is no larger emotional arc.  No thought-provoking big ideas.  No real backstory for the main character.  I really enjoy my nerdy friends and coworkers, yet find Mark Watney boring, obvious, and annoying.  The sardonic humor is unrelenting.  And the writing is regularly cliche and corny.  Ex. &#34;You wouldn't guess this botanist/mechanical engineer was a bit of a nerd in high school but indeed I was.&#34;  (har, har)  Or this gem: &#34;It's hydrogenville in the hab.&#34;  (Think my eyes rolled back into my head at this point.  Someone get me some oxygen! haha)  Mark Watney more closely resembles the office dweeb engineer than an esteemed botanist/mech eng/astronaut.  At least he talks like the former.  I love the idea for the story!  And I enjoyed watching Andy Weir talk about the book during the Google interview.  Clearly the author put a lot of effort into researching the science.  But, although I wanted to like the book, I just can't recommend it.  Am interested in watching the author develop as a writer and hope to enjoy future works.\",\n",
